notebooks from the POC phase of a supply chain prediction project at a F500 retailer
Raw data and additional context not available due to NDA commitmments.

What I can say is that the general idea was to build a classifier to predict a sub-optimal supply chain event with high precision to act as an input into an order-fullmillment engine.

This repo includes some work related to geo-coding which is more interesting than usual feature engineering work.  This repo shows me experiementing with the plotly visualization library.

It is important to note that the time between "data in hand" to POC was extremely short on this project.  Normally I prefer to write even the initial models with the scikit 'pipeline' syntax and experimentation framework, instead the the strange "one-shot train,test,validate,visualize" process i coded here.
